Summary
---
Last week I had some struggles keeping up with my goals. Partly, because I kept feeling like I wanted to do too many things. I want to focus on certain things like Programming for now, but I feel like I am neglecting other things I want to do as well, like getting better at art, or building up my Atomik3 brand. I am not sure how to balance everything. I'm going to attempt to try a new schedule however.
