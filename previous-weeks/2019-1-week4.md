### Week in Review:
Getting laid off wasn't necessarily a bad thing, I now get to focus on things I actually want to do for a bit now. I'll miss my awesome co-workers for sure. I did however, FAIL HARD on this list, but I will prevailll! Next week (since I have nothing but time on my hands now) I plan to finish up the sections of my Web Dev course listed last week. I also hated that I totally neglected working on my eating habits after what happened on Thursday.

AND FOR THE LOVE OF GOD, WHY WON'T THESE EMOJIS SHOW ON PC?!?!?!
