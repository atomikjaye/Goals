### Week in Review:
I'm feeling pretty defeated to be honest. I can't seem to get anything done right. I know these should probably be positive reviews, but I feel these are increasingly becoming negative. I want to leave these here in case it helps anyone. I hope my goals are met in the end so that who ever falls upon this knows it was hard and things happen.. but I did finish.

I ~~think~~ know my problem is that I want to do too many things. I need to calm some of these down. But knowing me, it's really hard to get rid of some of my goals, even if it's just temporary. I tried having every day of the week be something like T/Th were supposed to be creative and MWF were programming. But because I lack discipline, it usually ends up with me wasting a bunch of time.

So, because last week was a bit of a disaster (which I am sure it wasn't, but in my head it was), I'm hoping to really stick to these plans I keep setting.

<start pep talk>
I will get better with this. I am good enough. I am smart enough. I will do great things. KEEP BEING AWESOME JAYE! ❤❤
