Today I managed to almost finish section 31 of my web dev course. We are learning about RESTful Routes. I'm super excited that I was able to build a mini blogging platform. I do need to do a bit more research on some of the code to fully understand it. Otherwise, I'm really proud! I'm also really wanting to get into pixel art. I blame all the cool pixel artists on twitch!

> I'm grateful for my lovely parents.. even though they can work a nerve ðŸ’“

I got laid off today. I felt okay at first, but now I am a bit disappointed. But on the bright side, I get to do the things I want to do now. I can focus more on programming and hopefully travel a bit! Maybe it's a blessing in disguise?

> I'm grateful for all I've learned at my previous job, time to apply it to my personal projects! â˜”ðŸŒˆ

It's Friday! Day one of lay off. I'm feeling okay, still in shock really. Some co-workers messaged me which was really nice, I can imagine they are in shock as much as we are.

> I'm grateful for meeting all the wonderful people at my previous job. ðŸ˜Š

I'm currently on Section 34! I'm ahead of schedule! I'm still shooting this finish this course by the end of the week. Today was great, I streamed for a pretty long time, but I learned so much! I'm not starting to think about going back to school for Software Engineering. I'm still thinking about trying to achieve this by learning from various parts of the internets. I found this article, it's inspiring: https://medium.freecodecamp.org/how-i-went-from-newbie-to-software-engineer-in-9-months-while-working-full-time-460bd8485847 . They went super hardcore though. Given the variety of things I like to do. I do not think I would be able to achieve this quite so soon. But at least I have a somewhat outlined plan.

> Finding good advice is awesome, contemplating going back to school is exciting!

I can't believe it's February! I've declared my web course done today.. even though I need to do the very last Javascript Section. But aside from that, I learned what I wanted to finish. I thought about my project that I'd like to finish. It may be a hassle, but I think its doable. I also had an awesome stream and made a pretty cool piece of "ok" art! I hope to make stickers from them! I also inspired someone to open up an IG account! I'm really happy I inspired them to post their work and get out there! Now, I must listen to my own advice lol!

> Finally got some art done! I really can't wait to post it on my art instagram.

I didn't get to finish my "start a sewing project" item on my TODO list. But I hope to plan it a bit... being that it is now 10:12. I HAVE TIME! We went to the shore today, which was fun ^.^

> Taking a break and doing a day trip was really fun. I'm also really thinking about going back to school and travelling more.

Had a good stream today, Started my first dev project! At the end of my stream, unfortunately, I didn't get anything working. I am a bit overwhelmed with how many things I need to learn! I am also interested in challenging myself to read more. I also would like to watch more pop-culturey things... it amazes me how much I do not know.

> Starting my first dev project was a bit bumpy, but I hope to look back at this and be proud that I finished it.

Went to the gym today! I felt tired ALL DAY after. I really didn't get much done, buttt I started a pixel art class, and found a cool Computer Science Degree program completely free online. To be honest, it really overwhelms me. I'm quite discouraged. A part of me feels like I can't learn all this, the course takes 2 years to complete... if I'm not my normal lazy self. It is a lot, I also feel like I am not smart enough to complete this. I know these are just excuses. I really want to attempt these courses... so I am not taking the intro to CS course. Fingers crossed!  Also... I'm totally not re-reading these, apologies for errors.

> Went to the gym for the first time in a few months!
