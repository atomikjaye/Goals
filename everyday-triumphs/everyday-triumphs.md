Today I managed to almost finish section 31 of my web dev course. We are learning about RESTful Routes. I'm super excited that I was able to build a mini blogging platform. I do need to do a bit more research on some of the code to fully understand it. Otherwise, I'm really proud! I'm also really wanting to get into pixel art. I blame all the cool pixel artists on twitch!

I got laid off today. I felt okay at first, but now I am a bit disappointed. But on the bright side, I get to do the things I want to do now. I can focus more on programming and hopefully travel a bit! Maybe it's a blessing in disguise?

> I'm grateful for all I've learned at my previous job, time to apply it to my personal projects! â˜”ðŸŒˆ

It's Friday! Day one of lay off. I'm feeling okay, still in shock really. Some co-workers messaged me which was really nice, I can imagine they are in shock as much as we are.

I learned how to corn row, corn row with hair, and do an okay box-braid all within hours. I'm excited... 'bout to be kyoot out here!

> Learning how to FINALLY do some basic hair techniques is my happy moment for today. I can't wait!
