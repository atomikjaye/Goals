Today I managed to almost finish section 31 of my web dev course. We are learning about RESTful Routes. I'm super excited that I was able to build a mini blogging platform. I do need to do a bit more research on some of the code to fully understand it. Otherwise, I'm really proud! I'm also really wanting to get into pixel art. I blame all the cool pixel artists on twitch!
